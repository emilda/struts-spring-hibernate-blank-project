This is the example project.

To build the application's war file run ant archive
from the project's root folder.

The war file is created in the dist sub-folder.

Copy the war file to your Servlet container (e.g. Tomcat) and 
then startup the Servlet container.

In a web browser go to:  http://localhost:8080/sample.

You should see a web page with Welcome to Struts 2!
